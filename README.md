# kotlin_flashcards
A project in Kotlin as part of JetBrains Academy Kotlin courses. The program manages flashcards where the user can create decks of flashcards and save them in different files. The user can also import flashcards from these files and the program can use the flashcards to ask the user. Statistics are keeping track of the cards that have created most problems. It is also possible to provide command line parameters for import and export files.
